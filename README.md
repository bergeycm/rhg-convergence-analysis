## Batwa-Andamanese Rainforest Hunter-Gatherer Convergence Code

Code used in genomic analyses of hunter-gatherer populations by Christina Bergey ([website](http://www.cbergey.com)) et al. A paper describing the method been submitted for publication and is available as a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/18/300574) from [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/about-biorxiv):

>Bergey CM, Lopez M, Harrison GF, Patin E, Cohen J, Quintana-Murci L, Barreiro LB, & Perry GH. (Preprint). Polygenic adaptation and convergent evolution across both growth and cardiac genetic pathways in African and Asian rainforest hunter-gatherers.
